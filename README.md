## Credit Card Fraud Detection — Risk Analytics & ML Classification

## Overview
This project builds a fraud detection framework for credit card transactions using machine learning classification, root-cause analysis, and business-first cost-benefit evaluation to reduce fraud losses while controlling false declines.

## Business Problem
Credit card fraud leads to direct financial loss, customer trust damage, and operational burden. The goal is to detect suspicious transactions early and enable proactive risk controls.

## Objectives
- Identify fraud patterns and root causes behind rising fraud cases
- Build an ML-based fraud classification model for detection
- Optimize decision threshold using business cost-benefit trade-offs
- Recommend prevention and monitoring actions using structured analysis (5Ws + How)

## Approach (High-Level)
1) Root Cause Analysis of rising fraud cases
2) Data understanding + preprocessing (imbalance-aware)
3) ML model training, validation, and evaluation
4) Threshold optimization using cost-benefit analysis
5) Insights storytelling + recommendations for risk control

## Key Work Done (Action → Impact)
- Performed fraud trend diagnosis and structured root-cause breakdown to identify key drivers of rising fraud.
- Built an end-to-end fraud classification pipeline and evaluated model performance using precision/recall-focused metrics.
- Applied business-aligned threshold tuning to balance fraud capture vs false positives using cost-benefit analysis.
- Converted model + RCA insights into prevention recommendations and operational next steps for risk teams.
