    "## Problem Statement:-\n",
    "In the banking industry, detecting credit card fraud using machine learning is not just a trend; it is a necessity for the banks, as they need to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning helps these institutions reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denial of legitimate transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Buisness Objective:-** Suppose you are part of the analytics team working on a fraud detection model and its cost-benefit analysis. You need to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactional data of customers with a pool of merchants. Based on your understanding of the model, you have to analyse the business impact of these fraudulent transactions and recommend the optimal ways that the bank can adopt to mitigate the fraud risks.\n",

    "1. The fraudulent transaction probability of a transaction increases with increase in `hist_trans_avg_amt_24h` values. Based upon past spending pattern we have derived`hist_trans_avg_amt_24h` which is actually average amount spent through transactions in last 24 hours by the credit card holder's. So if comparable amount spent in last 24hrs v/s past spent data gets increased then its ideal for Bank to sent an SMS ALERT! to customer confirming about the transactions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The fraudulent transaction probability of a transaction increases with increase in `weekday_Thursday`, `weekday_Saturday` and `weekday_Monday` values. As per the pattern model shows that major fraud transactions are noticed in `weekday_Thursday`, `weekday_Saturday` and `weekday_Monday`. So banks need to be extra cautious and high alert on this specific days to avoid fradulent transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The fraudulent transaction probability of a customer increases with increase in `amt` values. At any point in time if bank notices the nature of amount spent is higher then regular spending pattern in such cases bank should noticed the same at early stage by sending neccessary alerts to customers.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. The fraudulent transaction probability of a customer increases with increase in `catg_home`, `catg_shopping_pos`, `catg_grocery_pos`, `catg_health_fitness`, `catg_gas_transport` values. Model predicted that major fraud transactions are occurred in the catg_home, catg_shopping_pos, catg_grocery_pos, catg_health_fitness`, `catg_gas_transports as these are the platform where any customer would spend large transactional amount so as fraudsters also follows the same trend. In such case its always recommended to bank to keep an eye on the track record of spend amount through FLASH SMS ALERT mentioning the detailed transaction history to respective credit card holders.    \n",
    "      \n",
    "5. The fraud transactions are majorly done during odd hours of the day i.e. between 22 - 3 Hr so banks needs to ensure to send an SMS ALERT during such odd hours."
